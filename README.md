Mode7Ex Extension Examples for Clickteam Fusion 2.5
These are some old project files I have worked on when I was experimenting with Mode7Ex extension in Clickteam Fusion 2.5
Many of these were available in the past but the download links have died out, so I have backed them up here for everyone to use once again.
The movement code in the final example file is a bit poor and definetally can be done easily without the Box2D extension, but rest works well enough.

## About Files
- Daggerfall 3D Example: This is a demake of Daggerfall's wilderness area. Code has describtions that will help you understand how the whole project works.
- Doom FPS Example: Doom-style FPS example with a toggling minimap and jumping. Has no describtions so take a look at Daggerfall first!
- Mode7 Test: This was my FIRST test with Mode7 that had sprite-mapping but without any collisions.
